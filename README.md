psmay-vim-settings
==================

This repo is for storing, recording, and syncing various vim
customizations across my systems. It's not intended for public
consumption as a bundle. (I won't stop you from using it as such, of
course.) If you try to do anything serious with it, well, good luck.

Installation
------------

This presumes that [https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen pathogen] (or
some similar bundle loader) has been installed. If you use `bzr`, make
sure that the `bzr-git` plugin is installed.

    cd ~/.vim/bundle # Windows: cd %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles
    bzr branch git+ssh://git@github.com/psmay/psmay-vim-settings.git,branch=master
    # or: git clone git@github.com:psmay/psmay-vim-settings.git
